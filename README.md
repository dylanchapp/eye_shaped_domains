eye_shaped_domains
==================

Matlab code to generate smooth eye shaped domains for numerical solution of tear film evolution equations

Takes as input a high speed digital video of a blinking eye and outputs a time dependent 2D domain bounded by a smooth closed plane curve. Uses standard image segmentation techniques and least squares fitting with a trigonometric basis to approximate the shape of the exposed ocular surface.
